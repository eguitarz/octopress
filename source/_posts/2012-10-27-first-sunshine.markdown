You know you're not gonna sit there and wait to die.

You know here is not the last place for you.

You got a big dream to bring up.

You got a strong plan to run up.

All you need is a meditation. A deep, slow talk to yourself.

If the 50% of you agree with yourself, than go for it.

Exhaust all your energy and do it, from the first sun shine to the last moon light.

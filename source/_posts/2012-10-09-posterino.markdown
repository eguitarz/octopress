I found [My cooking Diary](http://www.mycookingdiary.com/) recently. It shows a amazing present of photos, makes me really wondering the software it uses.

It is [Posterino](http://zykloid.com/posterino), which put many photos into one frame. It's not the newest thing, but it's delicate and useful.

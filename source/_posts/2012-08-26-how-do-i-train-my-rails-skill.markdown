To master a skill, you have to pay 10000 hours in, then you will be the guru in that field.

I believe repeating is the best way to master something well. I practice CRUD almost everyday. How? by building a todo list web site.

It sucks so much time at beginning, but once you are really familiar with Rails, you can create one less than 10 minutes. Such as [this guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aaHm9VImVE&t=4m0s), his name is Jserv, he can write an OS prototype in 15 minutes!

In addition to repeating, another thing is tool. You should prepare some tools to increase your speed on developing. Here are some tools worth to try:

- [Sublime 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) or [VIM](http://www.vim.org/)
- [Livereload](http://livereload.com/), auto refreshes your browser, it helps you to focus on your code.
- [Induction](http://inductionapp.com/), a polyglot database client.

Welcome to tell me if you know any goodies to share ~
